Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner.",

Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner.",

The course will consider some of these linguistic structures and communicative strategies in detail, beginning with early childhood development. How is it that children in every culture learn language so effortlessly despite its great complexity? The course aims to introduce students to a set of theories that address this and other puzzles and mysteries in the arena of language studies. Finally, since a central focus of the course is communication, it will strive to be as interactive as possible, with lots of scope for the discussion and working out of actual \u2018problems\u2019 in language use.",

It will then discuss theories about how science and technology (S&T) have shaped human development historically and the dynamics of technological change. Relationship between innovation and human development will be discussed using examples from the appropriate technology movement, health, education, nutrition, energy, environment, and others. Gender dimensions of S&T, indigenous knowledge, and radical critiques of S&T will be discussed.",

Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner.",

Sources of differentiation, diversity and unity are explored through institutions such as caste, class and tribe; kinship, family, marriage and gender systems, religious traditions and political organisations. Transformations in these institutions are analysed and fault lines explored by studying contemporary issues of secularism, communalism, religious conversions, caste and identity movements.

Then it will try to understand the process of distribution, growth and structural change using standard macroeconomic models. This course will be heavily dependent on Mathematics - mainly calculus.",

Is there a singular Indian tradition or is there a plurality of Indian traditions in the public sphere today? How do these find representation in the modern and textual frameworks? Is modernity antithetical to tradition? The aim of this course is to take up these varied questions along with their nuances to understand and re-negotiate Indian intellectual traditions. In this course, the examination of sources, structure, texts and exemplars from Indian intellectual tradition provide a theoretical framework for the discussion of contemporary political and social issues. Economic development, social justice, religion and the nation, communalism and secularism, caste, class and gender equality are themes to be addressed. The political misuse of tradition in programs of reform and revival both in the past and in modern times will be highlighted to underline the need for rethinking Indian Philosophy and intellectual tradition in an academically rigorous manner. This course will also take into cognisance the intellectual history of the ancient past as it comes through the Vedic thought and its contestations.",

Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The important role played by social structures and institutions such as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out. Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have transformed and are continuing to transform society and human relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these transformations at the global and local levels and consider their impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such as invitro-fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What does the emergence/ institutionalization of new social forms - such as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about the possibilities and limits of human relationships?",

We discuss the interface of culture, ways of thinking, feeling, acting and being in different organisations. This enables a shift from the managerial perspectives and psycho-social views of organisations, and draws out the complex negotiations and tensions endemic to organisational life.

Can evolutionary theories about language and tool-using help us understand how we continually manage today to process the world around us \u2018online\u2019? On this course, the class will be introduced to some state-of-the-art discussions in the interdisciplinary field of cognitive studies. These topics will include: (i) the modularity of mind (ii) the content of consciousness, (iii) the language bio-programme hypothesis, (iv) the relativism versus universals of controversy; (v) strong and weak positions on AI, etc. The course will rely on down- to-earth examples to demonstrate that such an interconnected area of study is not remote or esoteric but part of the intellectual excitement of living in the new millennium and attempting to anticipate both how it will shape us and how we will shape it.",

Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation \u2013 of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic  movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post- Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science? Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and machines alike?",
